# Module Redstonecloud-Plugin

This is the plugin for the Redstonecloud System.

This part is the only part of the Redstonecloud System that is strictly necessary to work.
This single jar must be included on every server and proxy (except the entry proxies which can use services to access the lower level).

This works for:
- Bukkit/Spigot/Paper 1.8+
- Bungeecord/Waterfall 1.16+
- Sponge 8
- Velocity 3.1.0+
- Krypton 0.60.3+
